# One-Night-At-The-Museum
This project have been made by me and 2 friends of mine during our first year in BUT.
It is a 2D game based on C# and Tiled library.

## Important to read
You have to be on windows to play this game.
Try to run the setup.exe first, and then jeu.exe (run even if the setup showed errors).
